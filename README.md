# game_space_cat

Space cat is a game written using the Qt framework.
In the game you need to move the cat with the arrow keys in order to eat sweets. If a cat catches a bomb, its number of lives will decrease. Also in the game you can increase the number of lives for every 50 eaten sweets.
If the number of lives becomes less than zero, the cat will die :(

In the future I plan to add many interesting features to the game.

### Requirements:
```
QT Creator 4.10.0
```

## Good game!
